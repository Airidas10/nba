This simple project was a part of my university assignment. It is made using PHP and MySQL, but it also features a little bit of basic HTML and CSS. 
The idea is simple: There are NBA players, who belong to teams and have their personal sponsors. The website users had to be able to search for these players and see all the information about them including all the sponsors, which created a many to many relationship between the database tables.
All the tables are outputted in the design page for people to see. 
Some of the more advanced features are: outputting all other players from the same team as the searched player and the search results paging system.
